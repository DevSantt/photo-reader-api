> A NodeJs API made with Express.js for parsing and working with PSD files.

### A bit of context

At first, i've created this API to use on a single project made with Fabric.js and HTML Canvas in a specific use case (I need to upload a PSD file and parse it in my Canvas project). But while i'm developing this I see a lot of potential in this project and I decided to share on a individual to expand and add more features to help the community with PSD parsing on whe Web. Feel free to contribute and help this idea to grow in something really good!

### Working...

This project is under development, and the future updates is focusing on the following features.

- [x] Create a first endpoint "/upload" that accepts a PSD file and return a array with all layers in a JSON format
